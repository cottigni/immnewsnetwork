		Good news is: The internet is a relatively safe space when it comes to good looks! If you want your website to be gorgeous, it doesn’t need to get a nose job or one of those savage diets.

It is the whole process of creating a website – from the first steps of planning and developing the layout – to picking the colors, graphics, and interactive images.
